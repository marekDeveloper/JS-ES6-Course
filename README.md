# JS-ES6-Course
Course repository for JS ES6 refreshing online course from es6.io.
Taking online course to refresh my JavaScript and ES6 skills and possible learning some new tricks.
I could download all course files from github repository, but I've decided to code them by myself for better learning experience.

Course contains 21 modules and about 77 videos with coding exmaples.

In this README file I will add my own personal notes. And I will try to track my progress. Sometimes it is hard to find time to take an online course part-time (at evenings or weekend).
